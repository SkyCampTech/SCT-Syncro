Use this script to Enable or Disable a login on a machine. You can pass usernames as:
* _username_
* _domain\username_
* _azuread\username_

In Syncro, you'll need three fields:
* loginStatus (Dropdown)
* * Disabled
* * Enabled
* username (text field where you enter the username, including DOMAIN\ or AzureAD\ )
* reboot (Dropdown)
* * yes
* * no

We use this to quickly enable or disable a user that might have some issues but we aren't ready to wipe the machine or remove a TPM key protector
