# FixUserShellFolderPermissions.ps1 - 230119.3
#
# Microsoft Customer Support and Services Helper Script
# Checks 'User Shell Folders' registry ACLs and fixes it by restoring inheritance, then registers app packages
# Except with -allprofiles, this tool needs to be run from the affected user context thus non-elevated
#
# Usage:
# - Fix (if needed) your current user profile:
#    .\FixUserShellFolderPermissions.ps1
# - Force the registration main Shell packages:
#    .\FixUserShellFolderPermissions.ps1 -register
# - Force the registration of every packages (might take long time):
#    .\FixUserShellFolderPermissions.ps1 -force
# - [Run As Admin] Attempt to recover every profiles, but won't register packages
#    .\FixUserShellFolderPermissions.ps1 -allprofiles
# - To accept the EULA and run the tool silently:
#    .\FixUserShellFolderPermissions.ps1 -accepteula
#
# This script is provided AS IS, no support nor warranty of any kind is provided for its usage.
